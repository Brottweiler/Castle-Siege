# Castle Siege

>A Minecraft PvP map made by [u/trainrex](https://www.reddit.com/user/trainrex/), made to work with [PGM](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM).

## Backstory

Castle Siege is a Minecraft PvP map [released](https://www.reddit.com/comments/ouzsr) **January 24th, 2012** on the Minecraft subreddit. It was made by [u/trainrex](https://www.reddit.com/user/trainrex/) and friends.

The thread has no comments but due to the nostalgia surrounding maps such as [Airship Battle](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/maps/1487240) and [Spaceship Battles](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/maps/1500489), I wanted to make it compatible for PGM.

## Gameplay

>The object of the game is to invade the other team's castle/fortress and retrieve their religious object. Said object is hidden in their altar. To get to the chest, you have to get through the layer of wool, then obsidian and finally to the chest(don't break the chest!). Retrieve the object and get it back to your castle safely.

### Capture the Wool

This quote makes it seem like this map would best fit as a **Capture the Wool**. Instead of a music disc in a chest, the chest could have wool. By how the map is right now, there are no wool rooms; or the entire inside of the main house in the castle could be the wool room, but that is quite the large wool room. 

It might be very easy to defend if there is no protection in the wool room. Will have to see how to do this the best way.

### Destroy the Monument

Another idea would be to make it a **Destroy the Monument** map where you have to break open the core, like on **A Watery Grave**, and simply destroy the block inside. In this case the chest with the music disc could be replaced with an enchanting table.
